I want to spend as little time on a computer as possible . . . 

Why . . .

• I get tired of being on a computer all day
• This philosophy promotes more efficient computing habbits. 
• Computers aren't as dynamic/interesting/exciting as people
• I like spending my time thinking like a human, not a computer

This movement away from roboticism requires some planning. I intend to use my skills on a computer to reduce my time using computers while allowing me to continue profiting from their usefulness. 

How . . . 

• I'll build a dashboard to quickly access commonly used configurations.
